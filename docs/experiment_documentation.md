## Physics Background

The double-slit experiment is one of the most important experiments in quantum mechanics, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of light. When coherent light passes through two closely spaced parallel slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen placed behind the slits.

### Key Concepts

**Wave Interference**: When two waves overlap, they can interfere constructively (bright fringes) or destructively (dark fringes).

**Coherence**: For interference to occur, the light waves must be coherent (same frequency and constant phase relationship). Laser light is highly coherent.

**Diffraction**: Light bends around obstacles and through openings, allowing it to reach areas that would be in shadow according to geometric optics.

### Historical Significance

- **Thomas Young (1801)**: First performed the double-slit experiment with sunlight
- **Demonstrates wave nature** of light, contradicting particle theory
- **Quantum mechanics**: Shows wave-particle duality when done with single photons
- **Modern applications**: Forms basis for quantum computing and quantum optics

## Theoretical Framework

### Mathematical Description

The intensity pattern on the screen is given by:

```
I(θ) = I₀ * [sin(β)/β]² * [cos(δ)]²
```

Where:
- `β = (π * a * sin(θ)) / λ` (single slit diffraction parameter)
- `δ = (π * d * sin(θ)) / λ` (double slit interference parameter)
- `a` = slit width
- `d` = slit separation
- `λ` = wavelength
- `θ` = angle from center

### Key Formulas

**Fringe Spacing on Screen**:
```
Δy = λD/d
```

**Bright Fringe Positions**:
```
y_m = mλD/d  (m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...)
```

**Dark Fringe Positions**:
```
y_m = (m + 1/2)λD/d  (m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...)
```

**Angular Positions**:
```
sin(θ_bright) = mλ/d
sin(θ_dark) = (m + 1/2)λ/d
```

### Physical Parameters

**Typical Values for Laboratory Setup**:
- Wavelength (red laser): 650 nm
- Slit width: 20-100 μm
- Slit separation: 100-500 μm
- Screen distance: 0.5-3 m
- Expected fringe spacing: 1-5 mm

## Physical Experiment Guide

### Materials Required

**Essential Components**:
- Laser pointer (red, 650nm preferred)
- Cardboard or foam board (10cm × 15cm)
- Aluminum foil
- Razor blade or X-acto knife
- White screen or wall
- Ruler and calipers
- Camera for documentation

**Optional Improvements**:
- Optical bench for precise alignment
- Digital calipers for measurements
- Neutral density filters
- Beam expander for uniform illumination

### Step-by-Step Construction

#### 1. Slit Preparation
1. Cut cardboard to 10cm × 15cm rectangle
2. Cover completely with aluminum foil, ensuring smooth surface
3. Using razor blade, cut two parallel slits:
   - Width: ~0.05mm (as narrow as possible)
   - Length: ~10mm vertical
   - Separation: ~0.2mm between centers
4. Ensure slits are straight and parallel

#### 2. Experimental Setup
1. Mount laser 2-3 meters from slit apparatus
2. Position slit holder perpendicular to laser beam
3. Place screen 1-2 meters beyond slits
4. Darken room as much as possible
5. Align laser to hit both slits simultaneously

#### 3. Alignment Procedure
1. Turn on laser (NEVER look directly into beam)
2. Adjust slit position until beam passes through both slits
3. Fine-tune alignment for clearest pattern on screen
4. Mark positions for repeatability

#### 4. Data Collection
**Measurements to Record**:
- Laser wavelength (check specifications or assume 650nm)
- Distance from laser to slits
- Distance from slits to screen  
- Slit width (estimate if unmeasurable)
- Slit separation (critical measurement)
- Fringe spacing on screen
- Number of visible fringes

**Photography Guidelines**:
- Overall setup showing all components
- Close-up of slit apparatus
- Clear interference pattern
- Pattern with ruler for scale reference
- Multiple angles and lighting conditions

### Safety Considerations

**Laser Safety**:
- Never look directly into laser beam
- Avoid reflections into eyes
- Use lowest power setting that produces visible pattern
- Inform others when laser is in use

**Construction Safety**:
- Handle razor blades carefully
- Secure all equipment to prevent falling
- Ensure electrical safety with laser power supplies

### Expected Results

**Successful Experiment Shows**:
- Central bright maximum (brightest fringe)
- Alternating bright and dark fringes
- Symmetric pattern about center
- Fringes become dimmer with distance from center
- Pattern disappears when one slit is blocked

**Common Observations**:
- 5-15 visible fringes per side
- Fringe spacing: 1-5mm for typical setups
- Central fringe 2-3 times brighter than side fringes
- Pattern width increases with screen distance

## Data Analysis

### Image Processing

**Extracting Intensity Profiles**:
1. Load experimental image
2. Convert to grayscale
3. Extract horizontal line through center
4. Normalize intensity values (0-1 range)
5. Apply smoothing if necessary

**Code Example**:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load and process image
image = cv2.imread('pattern.jpg')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
height, width = gray.shape
center_line = gray[height//2, :]
intensity = center_line.astype(float) / 255.0
```

### Pattern Analysis

**Peak Detection**:
- Identify local maxima (bright fringes)
- Find local minima (dark fringes)
- Calculate fringe spacing
- Count total visible fringes

**Quality Metrics**:
- Contrast ratio (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min)
- Pattern visibility
- Background noise level
- Symmetry about center

### Comparison with Theory

**Quantitative Analysis**:
- Correlation coefficient with theoretical pattern
- RMS error between experimental and theoretical
- Chi-squared goodness of fit
- Parameter estimation (slit separation, etc.)

**Common Discrepancies and Causes**:
- **Lower contrast**: Partially coherent light, slit width variations
- **Asymmetric pattern**: Misalignment, unequal slit widths
- **Background illumination**: Ambient light, scattered laser light
- **Missing fringes**: Slits too wide, insufficient screen distance

### Error Analysis

**Measurement Uncertainties**:
- Distance measurements: ±1mm typical
- Slit dimensions: ±10μm (difficult to measure precisely)
- Fringe spacing: ±0.1mm on screen
- Wavelength: ±5nm for typical laser

**Error Propagation**:
```
δ(Δy)/Δy = √[(δλ/λ)² + (δD/D)² + (δd/d)²]
```

Where δx represents uncertainty in parameter x.
